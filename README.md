DESC (Descriptors Extractor for Shape Contours) is a set of tools developed using MATLAB that leverage our research in image representation. DESC can generate shape descriptors for shape outlines (a sequence of points from shape contour) using two bags of words. The first bag uses words that are translation invariants, but not rotation invariants (see Fig. 2(a)). The second bag uses both translation and rotation invariant descriptors (see Fig. 2(b)).![image](https://github.com/mtparvez/DESC/assets/107982602/dd53d1dc-5e1d-438b-bd04-410ac1e7f1ff)
